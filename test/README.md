# Responsive Flexbox Tabs / Accordion - CSS Only

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josh_vogt/pen/EaaZbP](https://codepen.io/josh_vogt/pen/EaaZbP).

Made responsive using flexbox. Media queries change the flex-direction and order when the viewport is less than 600px wide.
